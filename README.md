## Hi, Iâ€™m Foong Ming

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), currently focused on learning the technical and social dimensions of large language models. My journey began in industry, where I spent 8 years building AI products as a product manager â€” leading cross-functional teams, shaping strategy, and delivering tools used across Deep Packet Inspection, Consumer Insights and Decarbonisation use cases.

Now, Iâ€™m digging deeper into how these models work under the hood â€” from fine-tuning and evaluation to questions of style and language variation. Iâ€™m especially interested in methods that augment LLM capabilities, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and parameter-efficient tuning approaches like LoRA.

### Interests
- Large language models and conversational AI

- Low-resource and colloquial NLP

- Human-centered evaluation and explainability

- Translating between research and product

### Recent Projects
- News Bias Classification: Comparing transformer and non-transformer models in classifying ideological bias in news (Completed)
	
- Emotional Support Chatbot: Fine-tuning a GPT-based model to study how Singaporean English affects user outcomes in emotionally supportive interactions (Ongoing)
	
- Hansard Q&A Bot: Building a local QA tool over Singaporeâ€™s parliamentary debates using vector search (Ideation/spike phase)
