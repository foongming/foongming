## Hi, I’m Foong Ming

I’m an AI product manager and recent NUS Master’s graduate focused on building practical, human-centered LLM products. Before grad school, I spent 8 years in industry leading cross-functional teams and shipping AI products across Deep Packet Inspection, Consumer Insights, and Decarbonisation.

My current work sits at the boundary of research and product: how to make LLM systems more reliable, controllable, and useful in real settings—through evaluation, retrieval, and adaptation.

### What I’m focused on
- LLM product development: problem framing, strategy, metrics, and iteration loops
- Fine-tuning & adaptation: RAG, SFT, LoRA/PEFT, prompt and data-centric improvement
- Human-centered evaluation and explainability

### Selected projects
**Web apps**
- [Hit the Jackpot! (IT5007 - A)](https://github.com/foongming/IT5007Project) — Real-time map view of HDB listings with historical transaction trends
- LightningCAT (CS5224 - A-) — Map-first ActiveSG-style web app with AI recommendations

**AI / LLM**
- [Endomondo Dataset Exploration (IT5100F - A+)](https://foongming.github.io/it5100f/IT5100F.html) — EDA, PCA, and exercise prediction using only 60s of data
- [News Bias Classification (CS5242 - A-)](https://github.com/foongming/CS5242Project) — Transformer vs non-transformer approaches for ideological bias classification
- [BERT, Llama and friends tackle SQuADv1.0 (CS4248 - A-)](https://github.com/foongming/CS4248_Project) — Improving EM/F1 via augmentation strategies
- Emotional Support Chatbot (CP5105 - A+) — Studying how Singaporean English affects outcomes in supportive interactions
- MCAT-How? (Ongoing) — RAG bot that personalizes MCAT study plans to user constraints and background

### Now
I’m looking for roles where I can build and scale LLM-enabled products end-to-end (discovery → delivery → measurement).
