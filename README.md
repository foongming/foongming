## Hi, I’m Foong Ming

I’m a Master’s student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), currently focused on learning the technical and social dimensions of large language models. My journey began in industry, where I spent 8 years building AI products as a product manager — leading cross-functional teams, shaping strategy, and delivering tools used across Deep Packet Inspection, Consumer Insights and Decarbonisation use cases.

Now, I’m digging deeper into how these models work under the hood — from fine-tuning and evaluation to questions of style and language variation. I’m especially interested in methods that augment LLM capabilities, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and parameter-efficient tuning approaches like LoRA.

### Interests
- Large language models and conversational AI

- Low-resource and colloquial NLP

- Human-centered evaluation and explainability

- Translating between research and product

### Projects
